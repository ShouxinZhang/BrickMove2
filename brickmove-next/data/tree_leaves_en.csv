"Let $A,B$ be Noetherian local rings and let $f: A \to B$ be a flat local ring homomorphism. Let $I = \mathfrak{m}_A B$ be the extended ideal in $B$. Consider the quotient (fiber) ring $B/I$ and the canonical quotient map $q: B \to B/I$. Since $f$ is local, i.e. $f(\mathfrak{m}_A) \subseteq \mathfrak{m}_B$, we have $I \subseteq \mathfrak{m}_B$, hence $B/I$ is still a nontrivial local ring. One checks that the maximal ideal of $B/I$ is the image of $\mathfrak{m}_B$ under $q$, namely $\overline{\mathfrak{m}_B}=\mathfrak{m}_B/I$.","IsLocalRing.local_hom_TFAE, Ideal.Quotient.mk",""
